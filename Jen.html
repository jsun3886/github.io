            Does life suddenly feel challenging or overwhelming? Deciding to
            start therapy is the first step in prioritizing your mental health
            and well-being. I&#39;m a licensed professional counselor and
            board-certified art therapist with over 15 years of experience
            working with adults and adolescents. I specialize in providing
            support to individuals experiencing anxiety, depression, grief/loss,
            trauma and difficult life transitions. I am a strength-based
            therapist who will support you with no judgment and provide you with
            a safe space to address your concerns and struggles. Together we
            will identify the steps you can take to better manage the stressors
            in your life. Sometimes it can be difficult to put into words the
            experiences youâ€™ve had. Art therapy is another modality I offer to
            clients who prefer a different and creative approach to processing
            thoughts and feelings. Therapy is a process and a journey. Together
            we will work on reaching the goals you would like to achieve, so you
            can feel better and have direction in managing your life
            circumstances. Please contact me to today to start your journey.
